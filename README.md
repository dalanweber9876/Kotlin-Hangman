# Overview
This is a command-line version of Hangman using Kotlin. This project was designed to learn and practice Kotlin. The program makes use of functions and classes. Each letter is stored in a list as a Letter, which contains the letter and whether it is visible or not. When the user guesses a letter, that letter is changed to visible, allowing the user to see it. The program runs until the user guesses the word or the stickman is built.

# Development Environment

I made this program in IntelliJ Idea using Kotlin. We also make use of the Random library to find a random index for the array of words.

# Future Work

- A scoreboard that can be loaded each session.
- Change from a console game to a game that opens in a seperate window. Better graphics included.
